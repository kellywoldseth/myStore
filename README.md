# myStore
## Description: I created an interactive website of a mock store. End users can browse products, click on products to get more details, and add products to the cart. From the cart page, users can edit quantities, delete items, clear cart, see the total cost, and checkout.

### Instructions
Run ```npm install```.
Change directory into ```myStore```, run ```ng serve```, and open ```localhost:4200```.
If there are any issues, run ```npm link @angular/cli```, then ```run npm install``` and ```ng serve```.
