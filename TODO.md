# TODO

How do I fetch and use data from an external API (or JSON data file)? Products stored in data.json in starter code.

determine component heirachry (parents and children) and how do i pass data between them (decorators, services?)

determine user input from forms- how to process it

How is routing set up in the templates? Likewise, how do I configure the app routing module to support this?

reminder: css and data.json have starter code if I want it
reminder: there's a video of end product to revisit


routes needed:
-products page (shows all products)
-product details (click on image... shows you prod details)
-cart page
-checkout form
-confirmation page


start with:
-plans (heirachy/relationships)
-product list component
-create model "Product" in typescript (like animal)
-generate services
-figure out how to fetch data from data.json
-create other components
-create routes
-ensure form input is validated
