# Author: Kelly Woldseth
# Date: July 2022


# Instructions
Run "npm install".
Change directory into "myStore" and run "ng serve" and open localhost:4200.
If there are any issues, run "npm link @angular/cli", then run npm install and ng serve.

# Would like feedback on:

When inside the cart, the user can increment and decrement the product quantity in cart and the total price should update accordingly. Currently, it only increments quantity. I have a question out to Udacity mentors but am submitting this project as is and will update that once I hear back from you or them on how to change that one thing.

Regarding that same feature, the rubric says "ngModelChange is used to listen to any ngModel changes (i.e., rather than change)," however ngModelChange does not work.
