# Would like feedback on:

When inside the cart, the user can increment and decrement the product quantity in cart and the total price should update accordingly. Currently, it only increments quantity. I have a question out to Udacity mentors but am submitting this project as is and will update that once I hear back from you or them on how to change that one thing.
